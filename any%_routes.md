# Base Game Levels

## Osaka Castle
See NMG

## Nakasendo Road
* Play the intro cutscene until the camera changes direction. This delays being seen by the first guards as you run by for as long as possible, saving health and avoiding view cone slow down.
* Run past the guards, taking a point of damage.
* Play Yuki's cutscene until Hayato takes out his sword and bobs his head 5 times. This lines up a double kill for Yuki.
* TP Yuki to the boulder and whistle to lure 2 officers.
* TP Hayato to the vines near the first ox.
* Wait until Hayato climbs a little bit up then throw a rock at the ox to kill the officer from the ledge. If you issue a rock throw too early, Hayato will climb down and throw the rock from the ground.
* TP Hayato to the vines across the river, cancel the climb, and crouch walk toward the statue.
* Yuki uses the boulder to try to kill both officers. Depends on RNG. If one is still alive, jump stab him and climb the nearby vine.
* Hayato distracts the left guard with a rock.
* Hayato runs to the meetup spot using the blind spot of the guard on the other side of the statue.
* Hayato shurikens the final officer from the meetup spot.
