# Base Game Levels

## Osaka Castle
See NMG WR.

## Nakasendo Road
* Prep general mouse position to move Hayato left (not precise)

* Run past the guards, taking a point of damage.
* Play Yuki's cutscene until Hayato takes out his sword and bobs his head 5 times. This lines up a double kill for Yuki.
* TP Yuki to the boulder and whistle to lure 2 officers.
* TP Hayato to the vines near the first ox.
* Wait until Hayato climbs a little bit up then throw a rock at the ox to kill the officer from the ledge. If you issue a rock throw too early, Hayato will climb down and throw the rock from the ground.
* TP Hayato to the vines across the river, cancel the climb, and crouch walk toward the statue.
* Yuki uses the boulder to try to kill both officers. Depends on RNG. If one is still alive, jump stab him and climb the nearby vine.

* Hayato runs to the meetup spot using the blind spot of the guard on the other side of the statue.
* Hayato shurikens the final officer from the meetup spot.
