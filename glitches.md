# Glitches

## Teleport Glitch
A character can teleport to an interactable by clicking the interactable immediately after beginning a jump.

## Quick Climb
A character can teleport up or down a ladder or vine by issuing a jump command while climbing. The timing going top-to-bottom is extremely precise, while going bottom-to-top is very flexible.

## Grenade Glitch / Door Glitch
Takuma can throw grenades through doors connecting two areas by standing by the edge of the door and throwing a grenade to a somewhat particular location on the other side.

## IGT Cut
You can mess with the in-game timer to get inaccurately short level times using save files. The use of save files is banned from all speedrun categories.

## Osaka Castle Shadow Mode Non-unlock
Shadow Mode may not activate even after Takuma's cutscene. Cause unknown.

## Okkoto Dance
In Hida Village, Okkoto will go into a glitched state if you evesdrop on him from a particular area in the corner of the buildings in front of him. He'll start twitching and the eavesdrop bar will drain and become unfillable, soft-locking the level.

## Epilogue Movie Mode
It's possible to play Epilogue with the cutscene bars still on screen. Cause and effects unknown.
