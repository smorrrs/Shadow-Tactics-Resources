# State of the Game
Information on potential time save over current WRs at the time of writing. 

The No Major Glitches (NMG) category, also called No Teleports, is pretty optimized. Of course there's always potential for new route discoveries or incremental improvements on execution, but many very skilled and clever players have put significant time into it. Any%, however, has clear room for improvement which I detail in this document. The No Alerts category (also allowing teleports) is wide open due to low runner engagement.

I've classified the obtainability of WR for each level into the following categories:
* OBTAINABLE: REFINE - WR uses teleports and can clearly be optimized.
* OBTAINABLE: ADD TP - WR doesn't use teleports and a teleport route saving time over NMG is known to be possible (it just hasn't been executed).
* OPTIMIZED: TP - WR uses teleports and is solid. Beating it will require exceptional skill or a new discovery.
* OPTIMIZED: NO TP - WR doesn't use teleports and teleports don't save time over the NMG WR as far as I can tell. Beating it will require exceptional skill or a new discovery.

# Base Game Levels

## Osaka Castle
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

Shadow Mode is disabled up until the cutscene where you meet Takuma, which means that teleports are only possible in the final section of the level. I don't see a way for teleports to save time over NMG.


## Nakasendo Road
OPTIMIZED: TP

Certainly there are extremely skilled runners who could squeeze out another second or two, but this is a short level and my run doesn't have much in the way of mistakes.


## Imai Town
OBTAINABLE: REFINE

A small optimization can be made to the current WR route by teleporting Yuki to the main road near the South Gate to whistle the 2 guards walking up and down the road. This allows Mugen to skip luring them with footsteps and killing them.


## Mount Tsuru
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

Teleports can theoretically save around 3 seconds over NMG if the runner can match the execution of the NMG WR.

Aiko can takedown Takuma's samurai by herself, but even so you can't unlock Takuma unless Mugen gets to him. Since Aiko can tp and Mugen can't, the bottleneck of this run is to get Mugen to Takuma as fast as possible. Ideally, you want Aiko to teleport ahead to clear Mugen's path. The one way to do this that I can see is to teleport Aiko to the bell and take out the two guards in front of the tunnel which skips Mugen having to use a sword wind. Aiko can achieve this by dropping the bell guard on one of the two tunnel guards then jumping down to stab the other.

I don't know how lining up the routes of the guards in the final section will go. If it's a bad line up, one idea is to then go ring the bell with Aiko and use the bell cutscene to move guards around.


## Lord Yabu's Estate
OPTIMIZED: TP

Probably even harder to beat than Nakasendo. Despite being the nearly same overall time length, this run only requires 5 seconds of critical execution: from starting the level until throwing the rock at the dog. The rest is basically on a timer that runners of most skill levels could achieve with some practice.


## Hida Village
OBTAINABLE: REFINE

Definitely a couple of seconds of execution-based time save here.


## Suganuma Village
OBTAINABLE: ADD TP

Route idea: 
* Takuma snipes for alert that clears the level above them (same as WR) and runs toward the tower by the road
* Yuki teleports to a roof north of Mugen and jump stabs the guard on the high ground while in sight of the tower guard, causing an alert clearing Mugen's area
* Takuma snipes the tower guard, climbs the tower, gets bullets, sets Kuma for guards by the ramp near the exit
* Yuki teleports to Mugen to free him 
* Yuki runs to ledge below her to teleport to villagers and rescues them (same as WR, this strat is really hard)
* Mugen runs to grab a rock to crush the guards distracted by kuma
* Takuma shoots the samurai by the road to let Mugen by
* Takuma shoots for an alert to help the villagers escape (same as WR)
* Takuma runs to the exit and grenades the exit guards that appear
* Everyone escapes


## Kanazawa City
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

This route is bottlenecked by Mugen getting to the barrel, carrying the barrel to the depot, then getting to the meetup point. The NMG already has him pretty much running straight there, but he does have some hold ups so perhaps speeding him along could be possible. I experimented with Hayato/Yuki teleporting to kill the officer and/or cause alerts but I didn't make any useful finds.


## Kage-sama's Camp
OPTIMIZED: TP

One route that's about the same time as WR is Hayato climbing up the tower and jumping over the fence instead of crouching through the gate, so optimizing this could potentially be faster. Hayato can't quick climb the ladder though because he has a path to walk to where he's teleporting from.

Aiko can quick climb the ladder and thus get to fake Kage faster than Hayato, but her pistol kill is slower and louder than Hayato's shuriken and using her requires even more camera movement.


## Mount Tsuru (Prison)
OBTAINABLE: ADD TP

Teleports can save 30+ seconds in the first section alone, but going a similar speed as WR in the rest of the level is really hard, even using relatively "safe" strats. 



## Matsuyama City
OBTAINABLE: REFINE

Room for improvement. Hayato can probably help Aiko clear out the exit before you cause the alert to isolate Masaru.


## Myougi Pass
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

There aren't many places to teleport from and to that are near where you need to be. You're bottlenecked by Takuma and Masaru, and I don't see any way for Yuki/Aiko teleports to help clear the path faster than is already done.


## Sunpu Castle
OPTIMIZED: TP

I can get 5 second time consistently, so 4 seconds is probably possible with god-like execution, particularly on the minimap click to move your screen to Noboru's courtyard. You'll have to make the click like lightning while still being extremely precise.


# DLC Levels - Aiko's Choice

## Nagoya City
OBTAINABLE: ADD TP

Even though you're bottlenecked by Mugen, teleports can surely save time. It's just a really long level which makes it difficult to pull off, and saving Yuki quickly is tough.


## Ise Bay
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

Teleports are not possible in this level.


## Toba Coastline
OBTAINABLE: REFINE

There are possbile optimization in both execution and route. Hydewx made some optimizations to NMG since the Any% run was done, primarily to Takuma's escape.


## Matsuyama City 2
OPTIMIZED: NO TP

Aiko's nearest teleport is way out of the way, definitely no way that it's helpful.


## Hana Gakuen
OBTAINABLE: REFINE

Execution can be crisped up.


## Epilogue
OPTIMIZED: TP

Most of the level is on a timer waiting for dialogue to finish before the next dialogue can begin. The only way to really save time would be finding some dialogue skips.
