# State of the Game - Any%
Information on where potential time save can be had over WRs in the Any% category at the time of writing. 

The No Major Glitches (NMG category), also called No Teleports, is pretty optimized. Of course there's always potential for new route discoveries or incremental improvements on execution, but many very skilled and clever players have put significant time into it. Any%, however, has clear room for improvement which I detail in this document. I am the only Any% runner, and there are certainly others who'd be able to beat my execution and find tricks and routes that I haven't.

Teleports are the only known major glitch for the game and thus the only difference between Any% and NMG. There are levels where teleports don't save any additional time compared to the NMG, so the same run can take WR for both categories. The No Alerts category (also allowing teleports) is wide open due to low runner engagement.

I've classified the obtainability of WR for each level into the following categories:
* OBTAINABLE: TP - WR uses teleports and can clearly be optimized.
* OBTAINABLE: NMG - WR doesn't use teleports and a teleport route saving time over NMG is known to be possible (it just hasn't been executed).
* OPTIMIZED: TP - WR uses teleports and is solid. Beating it will require exceptional skill or a new discovery.
* OPTIMIZED: NMG - WR doesn't use teleports and teleports don't save time over the NMG WR as far as I can tell. Beating it will require exceptional skill or a new discovery.

# Base Game Levels

## Osaka Castle
OPTIMIZED: NMG

Shadow Mode is disabled up until the cutscene where you meet Takuma, which means that teleports are only possible in the final section of the level. I don't see a way for teleports to save time over NMG.


## Nakasendo Road
OPTIMIZED: TP

This is my record and certainly there are extremely skilled runners who could squeeze out another second or two, but this is a short level and my run doesn't have much in the way of mistakes. I will not beat this time.


## Imai Town
OBTAINABLE

A small optimization can be made to the current WR route by teleporting Yuki to the main road near the South Gate to whistle the 2 guards walking up and down the road. This allows Mugen to skip luring them with footsteps and killing them.


## Mount Tsuru
OPTIMIZED: NMG

Teleports can theoretically save around 3 seconds over NMG if the runner can match the execution of the NMG WR.

Aiko can takedown Takuma's samurai by herself, but even so you can't unlock Takuma unless Mugen gets to him. Since Aiko can tp and Mugen can't, the bottleneck of this run is to get Mugen to Takuma as fast as possible. Ideally, you want Aiko to teleport ahead to clear Mugen's path. The one way to do this that I can see is to teleport Aiko to the bell and take out the two guards in front of the tunnel which skips Mugen having to use a sword wind. Aiko can achieve this by dropping the bell guard on one of the two tunnel guards then jumping down to stab the other.

I don't know how lining up the routes of the guards in the final section will go. If it's a bad line up, one idea is to then go ring the bell with Aiko and use the bell cutscene to move guards around.


## Lord Yabu's Estate
OPTIMIZED: TP

Probably even harder to beat than Nakasendo. Despite being the nearly same overall time length, this run only requires 5 seconds of critical execution: from starting the level until throwing the rock at the dog. The rest is basically on a timer that runners of most skill levels could achieve with some practice.


## Hida Village
OBTAINABLE: TP

Definitely a couple of seconds of execution-based time save here.


## Suganuma Village
OBTAINABLE: NMG

Route idea: 
* Takuma snipes for alert that clears the level above them (same as WR) and runs toward the tower by the road
* Yuki teleports to a roof north of Mugen and jump stabs the guard on the high ground while in sight of the tower guard, causing an alert clearing Mugen's area
* Takuma snipes the tower guard, climbs the tower, gets bullets, sets Kuma for guards by the ramp near the exit
* Yuki teleports to Mugen to free him 
* Yuki runs to ledge below her to teleport to villagers and rescues them (same as WR, this strat is really hard)
* Mugen runs to grab a rock to crush the guards distracted by kuma
* Takuma shoots the samurai by the road to let Mugen by
* Takuma shoots for an alert to help the villagers escape (same as WR)
* Takuma runs to the exit and grenades the exit guards that appear
* Everyone escapes


## Kanazawa City
Killing the officers and rescuing the prisoners are optional.

Killing an officer triggers allied forces to kill all enemies within an area around them. Enemies that you lure into this area will also be killed.

You can throw a grenade through the castle's front gate if you click to the side of the watchtower in the main courtyard.

Only the large barrel in the castle courtyard can blow up the depot, the small ones near Okkoto's tent don't affect it.

Okkoto has the same properties as a samurai, so anything that takes them down will take him down, including Mugen's pistol or an explosive barrel placed at his spawn location before he appears.


## Kage-sama's Camp
You end the level by carrying imposter Kage's body away from his mat. However, the direction you carry him affects how far you have to go before the cutscene triggers. Carrying him to the left is slightly faster than taking him right. Carrying him down is really slow, and carrying him up doesn't trigger the cutscene at all.


## Mount Tsuru (Prison)
You can escape Hayato without Takuma shooting the ice if you hit the guard with a rock to make him open the cell door. 

This can one of the tougher levels since you don't have weapons, but you can permanantly deal with enemies by throwing them off the numerous cliffs to make things a little easier.

If you lure away Aiko's guards, they will rush back to her as soon as you release her.

Mugen's cutscene is unskippable, but you can make the dialogue go faster by spamming click and ENTER. Once the screen widens, Mugen will wait for a player input before performing seppuku, otherwise he'll just sit there for ages.



## Matsuyama City
If you cause an alert in Masaru's compound, Masaru will run into its main building then exit out the back door without his bodyguards.


## Myougi Pass
The drugged alcohol only works if the servant brings it to the guards, so taking out the servant prohibits that strategy.


## Sunpu Castle
Noboru is immune to cutscene progression, he will always start in the courtyard regardless of where you skip the cutscene.

If you use Aiko's powder to blind the firing range guard named Itto Mogami Wagner as Noboru is watching them fire their guns, he will turn and shoot Noboru.

Set the audio language to Japanese. English audio adds an additional 10 second wait time after Noboru dies before the final cutscene starts.



# DLC Levels - Aiko's Choice

## Nagoya City
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Ise Bay
The sleeping guard by Takuma's cage won't wake up if Takuma runs by him or even if kuma howls. He'll only wake up if you touch him.


## Toba Coastline
The level ends when (1) all 5 crates are destroyed, and (2) Takuma is in the lifeboat. Your other characters' locations don't matter.


## Matsuyama City 2
Either character can pick up the document from the samurai when he's killed or knocked out.


## Hana Gakuen
Letting the first mid-level cutscene (passing through the statue puzzle door) play out some will move your characters' starting position compared to skipping the cutscene immediately, giving you a bit of free distance traveled in IGT.

Teleporting to the complex entrance's floor spike trap's switch while holding CTRL to activate it can teleport you into the activating spikes, insta-killing yourself. To avoid this, teleport without holding CTRL, or you can also adjust the camera angle to a position where this doesn't happen.

Chiyo doesn't have any special defenses, anything that kills a normal enemy will take her out.

It's possible to snipe Chiyo with Takuma from the riverbank near the exit.


## Epilogue
Using English audio saves around 40 seconds compared to Japanese audio for the Any% run of this level.

After talking to Hayato, you can see and teleport to the bowl at the hill-top shrine even before that part of the map is revealed with the correct camera positioning. This skips walking distance and some of Hayato's dialogue.
