## General Challenge Rulesets
These are my personal suggestions for challenge rulesets and all are recommended to be glitchless. But use any ruleset you find the most interesting.

**Solo Character**
* Select 1 character to be unrestricted 
* Other characters may only perform required actions that the solo character cannot perform (moving to meetup points, Mugen carrying barrels, etc.) and may not trigger alerts or suspicion.
* Advanced challenge: Other characters may only move directly to required actions and may only run for their movement.


**Min Skills**
* Complete a level with the fewest number of skills used appearing on the final stats screen


**Shadow Run** 
* Minimize alerts 
* Minimize kills
* Minimize attacks (e.g. knockouts)

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.


**Ghost Run**
* Minimize alerts
* Minimize kills
* Minimize skills used

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.
