# Challenge Runs
Non-speed-based challenges for the game.

## Community Challenges
Challenges created by community members. Most are challenges are designed to be as difficult as possible with level-specific tweaks.

## General Challenge Rulesets
These are my personal suggestions for challenge rulesets applicable to all levels, although some challenge-level combos may be impossible. All challenges could be done with or without glitches, although glitchless will often be the higher challenge. Use any ruleset that you find interesting.

**Solo Character**
* Select 1 character to be unrestricted.
* Other characters may only perform required actions that the solo character cannot perform (moving to meetup points, Mugen carrying barrels, etc.)
* Other character may not trigger alerts or suspicion.
* Advanced challenge: Other characters may only move directly to required actions and may only run for their movement.


**Min Skills**
* Minimize skills used (as appear on the final stats screen)


**Shadow Run** 
* Minimize alerts 
* Minimize kills
* Minimize attacks (e.g. knockouts)

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.


**Ghost Run**
* Minimize alerts
* Minimize kills
* Minimize skills used

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.
