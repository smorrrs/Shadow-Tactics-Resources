Non-speed-based challenges for the game.

## General Challenge Rulesets
These are my personal suggestions for challenge rulesets applicable to all levels, although some challenge-level combos may be impossible. All challenges could be done with or without glitches, although glitchless will often be the higher challenge. Use any ruleset that you find interesting.

**Solo Character**
* Select 1 character to be unrestricted.
* Minimize actions performed by other characters: skills, interactions, triggering alerts/suspicion.
* Advanced challenge: minimize moves by other characters, and they may only run to move.

I categorize completions into 3 categories:
* 0: Other characters perform no actions
* R: Other characters perform the minimum possible actions and moves (1 move command per character per meetup + 1 move/action per required action), running only
* M: Other characters perform the minimum possible actions (any movement is allowed)


**Min Skills**
* Minimize skills used (as appear on the final stats screen)


**Shadow Run** 
* Minimize alerts 
* Minimize kills
* Minimize attacks (e.g. knockouts)

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.


**Ghost Run**
* Minimize alerts
* Minimize kills
* Minimize skills used

This list is in priority order. For example, a run with 1 kill and nothing else is ranked higher than a run with 1 alert and nothing else.
